# Face_Recognition
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect and recognize human faces. The accuracy can be greater than 99%.
This project uses Dlib C++ library. Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for
creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. 
Before you play with the program, make sure you have your own training dataset which contains a set of photos. Each photo
is labelled with the name of the person in it. For the test, you can feed a different photo into it. 
Please specify the paths of the folders of training photos and testing photos in the program.
